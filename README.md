🔤 Python String Programs Collection
📌 Description
This repository contains a collection of basic to intermediate Python string manipulation programs.
These programs are useful for interview preparation, logic building, and understanding core Python concepts like loops, sets, strings, and built-in functions.

🧩 Programs Included
1️⃣ Find Duplicate Characters in a String

Problem: Identify duplicate characters in a given string.

Logic Used:

Use a set to track seen characters

Store duplicates in another set

Example Output:

{'r', 'g', 'm'}

2️⃣ Remove Duplicates from a String

Problem: Remove repeated characters while maintaining order.

Logic Used:

Traverse the string

Add character only if not already present in result

Example Output:

ban

3️⃣ Check if Two Strings are Anagrams

Problem: Check whether two strings contain the same characters in different order.

Logic Used:

Sort both strings

Compare sorted results

Example Output:

Anagram

4️⃣ Reverse Words in a Sentence

Problem: Reverse the order of words in a sentence.

Logic Used:

split() to convert sentence into words

Reverse list using slicing

join() to rebuild sentence

Example Output:

python love I

5️⃣ Find First Non-Repeating Character

Problem: Find the first character that does not repeat.

Logic Used:

Use count() method

Print first character with count = 1

Example Output:

w

6️⃣ Replace Spaces with Special Characters

Problem: Replace spaces in a string with @.

Logic Used:

Use replace() function

Example Output:

hello@world@python

7️⃣ Capitalize First Letter of Each Word

Problem: Capitalize the first letter of every word in a sentence.

Logic Used:

Use title() method

Example Output:

Python Is Easy
